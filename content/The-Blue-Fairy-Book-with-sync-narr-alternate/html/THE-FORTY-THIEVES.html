    <h1>THE FORTY THIEVES</h1>
    <p>In a town in Persia there dwelt two brothers, one named Cassim, the other Ali Baba. Cassim was married to a rich
        wife and lived in plenty, while Ali Baba had to maintain his wife and children by cutting wood in a neighboring
        forest and selling it in the town. One day, when Ali Baba was in the forest, he saw a troop of men on horseback,
        coming toward him in a cloud of dust. He was afraid they were robbers, and climbed into a tree for safety. When
        they came up to him and dismounted, he counted forty of them. They unbridled their horses and tied them to
        trees. The finest man among them, whom Ali Baba took to be their captain, went a little way among some bushes,
        and said: “Open, Sesame!”(1) so plainly that Ali Baba heard him. A door opened in the rocks, and having made the
        troop go in, he followed them, and the door shut again of itself. They stayed some time inside, and Ali Baba,
        fearing they might come out and catch him, was forced to sit patiently in the tree. At last the door opened
        again, and the Forty Thieves came out. As the Captain went in last he came out first, and made them all pass by
        him; he then closed the door, saying: “Shut, Sesame!” Every man bridled his horse and mounted, the Captain put
        himself at their head, and they returned as they came.</p>
    <p>(1) Sesame is a kind of grain.</p>
    <p>Then Ali Baba climbed down and went to the door concealed among the bushes, and said: “Open, Sesame!” and it flew
        open. Ali Baba, who expected a dull, dismal place, was greatly surprised to find it large and well lighted,
        hollowed by the hand of man in the form of a vault, which received the light from an opening in the ceiling. He
        saw rich bales of merchandise—silk, stuff-brocades, all piled together, and gold and silver in heaps, and money
        in leather purses. He went in and the door shut behind him. He did not look at the silver, but brought out as
        many bags of gold as he thought his asses, which were browsing outside, could carry, loaded them with the bags,
        and hid it all with fagots. Using the words: “Shut, Sesame!” he closed the door and went home.</p>
    <p>Then he drove his asses into the yard, shut the gates, carried the money-bags to his wife, and emptied them out
        before her. He bade her keep the secret, and he would go and bury the gold. “Let me first measure it,” said his
        wife. “I will go borrow a measure of someone, while you dig the hole.” So she ran to the wife of Cassim and
        borrowed a measure. Knowing Ali Baba’s poverty, the sister was curious to find out what sort of grain his wife
        wished to measure, and artfully put some suet at the bottom of the measure. Ali Baba’s wife went home and set
        the measure on the heap of gold, and filled it and emptied it often, to her great content. She then carried it
        back to her sister, without noticing that a piece of gold was sticking to it, which Cassim’s wife perceived
        directly her back was turned. She grew very curious, and said to Cassim when he came home: “Cassim, your brother
        is richer than you. He does not count his money, he measures it.” He begged her to explain this riddle, which
        she did by showing him the piece of money and telling him where she found it. Then Cassim grew so envious that
        he could not sleep, and went to his brother in the morning before sunrise. “Ali Baba,” he said, showing him the
        gold piece, “you pretend to be poor and yet you measure gold.” By this Ali Baba perceived that through his
        wife’s folly Cassim and his wife knew their secret, so he confessed all and offered Cassim a share. “That I
        expect,” said Cassim; “but I must know where to find the treasure, otherwise I will discover all, and you will
        lose all.” Ali Baba, more out of kindness than fear, told him of the cave, and the very words to use. Cassim
        left Ali Baba, meaning to be beforehand with him and get the treasure for himself. He rose early next morning,
        and set out with ten mules loaded with great chests. He soon found the place, and the door in the rock. He said:
        “Open, Sesame!” and the door opened and shut behind him. He could have feasted his eyes all day on the
        treasures, but he now hastened to gather together as much of it as possible; but when he was ready to go he
        could not remember what to say for thinking of his great riches. Instead of “Sesame,” he said: “Open, Barley!”
        and the door remained fast. He named several different sorts of grain, all but the right one, and the door still
        stuck fast. He was so frightened at the danger he was in that he had as much forgotten the word as if he had
        never heard it.</p>
    <p>About noon the robbers returned to their cave, and saw Cassim’s mules roving about with great chests on their
        backs. This gave them the alarm; they drew their sabres, and went to the door, which opened on their Captain’s
        saying: “Open, Sesame!” Cassim, who had heard the trampling of their horses’ feet, resolved to sell his life
        dearly, so when the door opened he leaped out and threw the Captain down. In vain, however, for the robbers with
        their sabres soon killed him. On entering the cave they saw all the bags laid ready, and could not imagine how
        anyone had got in without knowing their secret. They cut Cassim’s body into four quarters, and nailed them up
        inside the cave, in order to frighten anyone who should venture in, and went away in search of more treasure.
    </p>
    <p>As night drew on Cassim’s wife grew very uneasy, and ran to her brother-in-law, and told him where her husband
        had gone. Ali Baba did his best to comfort her, and set out to the forest in search of Cassim. The first thing
        he saw on entering the cave was his dead brother. Full of horror, he put the body on one of his asses, and bags
        of gold on the other two, and, covering all with some fagots, returned home. He drove the two asses laden with
        gold into his own yard, and led the other to Cassim’s house. The door was opened by the slave Morgiana, whom he
        knew to be both brave and cunning. Unloading the ass, he said to her: “This is the body of your master, who has
        been murdered, but whom we must bury as though he had died in his bed. I will speak with you again, but now tell
        your mistress I am come.” The wife of Cassim, on learning the fate of her husband, broke out into cries and
        tears, but Ali Baba offered to take her to live with him and his wife if she would promise to keep his counsel
        and leave everything to Morgiana; whereupon she agreed, and dried her eyes.</p>
    <p>Morgiana, meanwhile, sought an apothecary and asked him for some lozenges. “My poor master,” she said, “can
        neither eat nor speak, and no one knows what his distemper is.” She carried home the lozenges and returned next
        day weeping, and asked for an essence only given to those just about to die. Thus, in the evening, no one was
        surprised to hear the wretched shrieks and cries of Cassim’s wife and Morgiana, telling everyone that Cassim was
        dead. The day after Morgiana went to an old cobbler near the gates of the town who opened his stall early, put a
        piece of gold in his hand, and bade him follow her with his needle and thread. Having bound his eyes with a
        handkerchief, she took him to the room where the body lay, pulled off the bandage, and bade him sew the quarters
        together, after which she covered his eyes again and led him home. Then they buried Cassim, and Morgiana his
        slave followed him to the grave, weeping and tearing her hair, while Cassim’s wife stayed at home uttering
        lamentable cries. Next day she went to live with Ali Baba, who gave Cassim’s shop to his eldest son.</p>
    <p>The Forty Thieves, on their return to the cave, were much astonished to find Cassim’s body gone and some of their
        money-bags. “We are certainly discovered,” said the Captain, “and shall be undone if we cannot find out who it
        is that knows our secret. Two men must have known it; we have killed one, we must now find the other. To this
        end one of you who is bold and artful must go into the city dressed as a traveler, and discover whom we have
        killed, and whether men talk of the strange manner of his death. If the messenger fails he must lose his life,
        lest we be betrayed.” One of the thieves started up and offered to do this, and after the rest had highly
        commended him for his bravery he disguised himself, and happened to enter the town at daybreak, just by Baba
        Mustapha’s stall. The thief bade him good-day, saying: “Honest man, how can you possibly see to stitch at your
        age?” “Old as I am,” replied the cobbler, “I have very good eyes, and will you believe me when I tell you that I
        sewed a dead body together in a place where I had less light than I have now.” The robber was overjoyed at his
        good fortune, and, giving him a piece of gold, desired to be shown the house where he stitched up the dead body.
        At first Mustapha refused, saying that he had been blindfolded; but when the robber gave him another piece of
        gold he began to think he might remember the turnings if blindfolded as before. This means succeeded; the robber
        partly led him, and was partly guided by him, right in front of Cassim’s house, the door of which the robber
        marked with a piece of chalk. Then, well pleased, he bade farewell to Baba Mustapha and returned to the forest.
        By and by Morgiana, going out, saw the mark the robber had made, quickly guessed that some mischief was brewing,
        and fetching a piece of chalk marked two or three doors on each side, without saying anything to her master or
        mistress.</p>
    <p>The thief, meantime, told his comrades of his discovery. The Captain thanked him, and bade him show him the house
        he had marked. But when they came to it they saw that five or six of the houses were chalked in the same manner.
        The guide was so confounded that he knew not what answer to make, and when they returned he was at once beheaded
        for having failed. Another robber was dispatched, and, having won over Baba Mustapha, marked the house in red
        chalk; but Morgiana being again too clever for them, the second messenger was put to death also. The Captain now
        resolved to go himself, but, wiser than the others, he did not mark the house, but looked at it so closely that
        he could not fail to remember it. He returned, and ordered his men to go into the neighboring villages and buy
        nineteen mules, and thirty-eight leather jars, all empty except one, which was full of oil. The Captain put one
        of his men, fully armed, into each, rubbing the outside of the jars with oil from the full vessel. Then the
        nineteen mules were loaded with thirty-seven robbers in jars, and the jar of oil, and reached the town by dusk.
        The Captain stopped his mules in front of Ali Baba’s house, and said to Ali Baba, who was sitting outside for
        coolness: “I have brought some oil from a distance to sell at to-morrow’s market, but it is now so late that I
        know not where to pass the night, unless you will do me the favor to take me in.” Though Ali Baba had seen the
        Captain of the robbers in the forest, he did not recognize him in the disguise of an oil merchant. He bade him
        welcome, opened his gates for the mules to enter, and went to Morgiana to bid her prepare a bed and supper for
        his guest. He brought the stranger into his hall, and after they had supped went again to speak to Morgiana in
        the kitchen, while the Captain went into the yard under pretense of seeing after his mules, but really to tell
        his men what to do. Beginning at the first jar and ending at the last, he said to each man: “As soon as I throw
        some stones from the window of the chamber where I lie, cut the jars open with your knives and come out, and I
        will be with you in a trice.” He returned to the house, and Morgiana led him to his chamber. She then told
        Abdallah, her fellow-slave, to set on the pot to make some broth for her master, who had gone to bed. Meanwhile
        her lamp went out, and she had no more oil in the house. “Do not be uneasy,” said Abdallah; “go into the yard
        and take some out of one of those jars.” Morgiana thanked him for his advice, took the oil pot, and went into
        the yard. When she came to the first jar the robber inside said softly: “Is it time?”</p>
    <p>Any other slave but Morgiana, on finding a man in the jar instead of the oil she wanted, would have screamed and
        made a noise; but she, knowing the danger her master was in, bethought herself of a plan, and answered quietly:
        “Not yet, but presently.” She went to all the jars, giving the same answer, till she came to the jar of oil. She
        now saw that her master, thinking to entertain an oil merchant, had let thirty-eight robbers into his house. She
        filled her oil pot, went back to the kitchen, and, having lit her lamp, went again to the oil jar and filled a
        large kettle full of oil. When it boiled she went and poured enough oil into every jar to stifle and kill the
        robber inside. When this brave deed was done she went back to the kitchen, put out the fire and the lamp, and
        waited to see what would happen.</p>
    <p>In a quarter of an hour the Captain of the robbers awoke, got up, and opened the window. As all seemed quiet, he
        threw down some little pebbles which hit the jars. He listened, and as none of his men seemed to stir he grew
        uneasy, and went down into the yard. On going to the first jar and saying, “Are you asleep?” he smelt the hot
        boiled oil, and knew at once that his plot to murder Ali Baba and his household had been discovered. He found
        all the gang was dead, and, missing the oil out of the last jar, became aware of the manner of their death. He
        then forced the lock of a door leading into a garden, and climbing over several walls made his escape. Morgiana
        heard and saw all this, and, rejoicing at her success, went to bed and fell asleep.</p>
    <p>At daybreak Ali Baba arose, and, seeing the oil jars still there, asked why the merchant had not gone with his
        mules. Morgiana bade him look in the first jar and see if there was any oil. Seeing a man, he started back in
        terror. “Have no fear,” said Morgiana; “the man cannot harm you: he is dead.” Ali Baba, when he had recovered
        somewhat from his astonishment, asked what had become of the merchant. “Merchant!” said she, “he is no more a
        merchant than I am!” and she told him the whole story, assuring him that it was a plot of the robbers of the
        forest, of whom only three were left, and that the white and red chalk marks had something to do with it. Ali
        Baba at once gave Morgiana her freedom, saying that he owed her his life. They then buried the bodies in Ali
        Baba’s garden, while the mules were sold in the market by his slaves.</p>
    <p>The Captain returned to his lonely cave, which seemed frightful to him without his lost companions, and firmly
        resolved to avenge them by killing Ali Baba. He dressed himself carefully, and went into the town, where he took
        lodgings in an inn. In the course of a great many journeys to the forest he carried away many rich stuffs and
        much fine linen, and set up a shop opposite that of Ali Baba’s son. He called himself Cogia Hassan, and as he
        was both civil and well dressed he soon made friends with Ali Baba’s son, and through him with Ali Baba, whom he
        was continually asking to sup with him. Ali Baba, wishing to return his kindness, invited him into his house and
        received him smiling, thanking him for his kindness to his son. When the merchant was about to take his leave
        Ali Baba stopped him, saying: “Where are you going, sir, in such haste? Will you not stay and sup with me?” The
        merchant refused, saying that he had a reason; and, on Ali Baba’s asking him what that was, he replied: “It is,
        sir, that I can eat no victuals that have any salt in them.” “If that is all,” said Ali Baba, “let me tell you
        that there shall be no salt in either the meat or the bread that we eat to-night.” He went to give this order to
        Morgiana, who was much surprised. “Who is this man,” she said, “who eats no salt with his meat?” “He is an
        honest man, Morgiana,” returned her master; “therefore do as I bid you.” But she could not withstand a desire to
        see this strange man, so she helped Abdallah to carry up the dishes, and saw in a moment that Cogia Hassan was
        the robber Captain, and carried a dagger under his garment. “I am not surprised,” she said to herself, “that
        this wicked man, who intends to kill my master, will eat no salt with him; but I will hinder his plans.”</p>
    <p>She sent up the supper by Abdallah, while she made ready for one of the boldest acts that could be thought on.
        When the dessert had been served, Cogia Hassan was left alone with Ali Baba and his son, whom he thought to make
        drunk and then to murder them. Morgiana, meanwhile, put on a head-dress like a dancing-girl’s, and clasped a
        girdle round her waist, from which hung a dagger with a silver hilt, and said to Abdallah: “Take your tabor, and
        let us go and divert our master and his guest.” Abdallah took his tabor and played before Morgiana until they
        came to the door, where Abdallah stopped playing and Morgiana made a low courtesy. “Come in, Morgiana,” said Ali
        Baba, “and let Cogia Hassan see what you can do”; and, turning to Cogia Hassan, he said: “She’s my slave and my
        housekeeper.” Cogia Hassan was by no means pleased, for he feared that his chance of killing Ali Baba was gone
        for the present; but he pretended great eagerness to see Morgiana, and Abdallah began to play and Morgiana to
        dance. After she had performed several dances she drew her dagger and made passes with it, sometimes pointing it
        at her own breast, sometimes at her master’s, as if it were part of the dance. Suddenly, out of breath, she
        snatched the tabor from Abdallah with her left hand, and, holding the dagger in her right hand, held out the
        tabor to her master. Ali Baba and his son put a piece of gold into it, and Cogia Hassan, seeing that she was
        coming to him, pulled out his purse to make her a present, but while he was putting his hand into it Morgiana
        plunged the dagger into his heart.</p>
    <p>“Unhappy girl!” cried Ali Baba and his son, “what have you done to ruin us?”</p>
    <p>“It was to preserve you, master, not to ruin you,” answered Morgiana. “See here,” opening the false merchant’s
        garment and showing the dagger; “see what an enemy you have entertained! Remember, he would eat no salt with
        you, and what more would you have? Look at him! he is both the false oil merchant and the Captain of the Forty
        Thieves.”</p>
    <p>Ali Baba was so grateful to Morgiana for thus saving his life that he offered her to his son in marriage, who
        readily consented, and a few days after the wedding was celebrated with greatest splendor.</p>
    <p>At the end of a year Ali Baba, hearing nothing of the two remaining robbers, judged they were dead, and set out
        to the cave. The door opened on his saying: “Open Sesame!” He went in, and saw that nobody had been there since
        the Captain left it. He brought away as much gold as he could carry, and returned to town. He told his son the
        secret of the cave, which his son handed down in his turn, so the children and grandchildren of Ali Baba were
        rich to the end of their lives.(1)</p>
