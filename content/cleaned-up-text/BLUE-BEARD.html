    <h1>BLUE BEARD</h1>
    <p>There was a man who had fine houses, both in town and country, a deal of silver and gold plate, embroidered
        furniture, and coaches gilded all over with gold. But this man was so unlucky as to have a blue beard, which
        made him so frightfully ugly that all the women and girls ran away from him.</p>
    <p>One of his neighbors, a lady of quality, had two daughters who were perfect beauties. He desired of her one of
        them in marriage, leaving to her choice which of the two she would bestow on him. They would neither of them
        have him, and sent him backward and forward from one another, not being able to bear the thoughts of marrying a
        man who had a blue beard, and what besides gave them disgust and aversion was his having already been married to
        several wives, and nobody ever knew what became of them.</p>
    <p>Blue Beard, to engage their affection, took them, with the lady their mother and three or four ladies of their
        acquaintance, with other young people of the neighborhood, to one of his country seats, where they stayed a
        whole week.</p>
    <p>There was nothing then to be seen but parties of pleasure, hunting, fishing, dancing, mirth, and feasting. Nobody
        went to bed, but all passed the night in rallying and joking with each other. In short, everything succeeded so
        well that the youngest daughter began to think the master of the house not to have a beard so very blue, and
        that he was a mighty civil gentleman.</p>
    <p>As soon as they returned home, the marriage was concluded. About a month afterward, Blue Beard told his wife that
        he was obliged to take a country journey for six weeks at least, about affairs of very great consequence,
        desiring her to divert herself in his absence, to send for her friends and acquaintances, to carry them into the
        country, if she pleased, and to make good cheer wherever she was.</p>
    <p>“Here,” said he, “are the keys of the two great wardrobes, wherein I have my best furniture; these are of my
        silver and gold plate, which is not every day in use; these open my strong boxes, which hold my money, both gold
        and silver; these my caskets of jewels; and this is the master-key to all my apartments. But for this little one
        here, it is the key of the closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor. Open them all; go into
        all and every one of them, except that little closet, which I forbid you, and forbid it in such a manner that,
        if you happen to open it, there’s nothing but what you may expect from my just anger and resentment.”</p>
    <p>She promised to observe, very exactly, whatever he had ordered; when he, after having embraced her, got into his
        coach and proceeded on his journey.</p>
    <p>Her neighbors and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the new married lady, so great was their impatience
        to see all the rich furniture of her house, not daring to come while her husband was there, because of his blue
        beard, which frightened them. They ran through all the rooms, closets, and wardrobes, which were all so fine and
        rich that they seemed to surpass one another.</p>
    <p>After that they went up into the two great rooms, where was the best and richest furniture; they could not
        sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the tapestry, beds, couches, cabinets, stands, tables, and
        looking-glasses, in which you might see yourself from head to foot; some of them were framed with glass, others
        with silver, plain and gilded, the finest and most magnificent ever were seen.</p>
    <p>They ceased not to extol and envy the happiness of their friend, who in the meantime in no way diverted herself
        in looking upon all these rich things, because of the impatience she had to go and open the closet on the ground
        floor. She was so much pressed by her curiosity that, without considering that it was very uncivil to leave her
        company, she went down a little back staircase, and with such excessive haste that she had twice or thrice like
        to have broken her neck.</p>
    <p>Coming to the closet-door, she made a stop for some time, thinking upon her husband’s orders, and considering
        what unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient; but the temptation was so strong she could not
        overcome it. She then took the little key, and opened it, trembling, but could not at first see anything
        plainly, because the windows were shut. After some moments she began to perceive that the floor was all covered
        over with clotted blood, on which lay the bodies of several dead women, ranged against the walls. (These were
        all the wives whom Blue Beard had married and murdered, one after another.) She thought she should have died for
        fear, and the key, which she pulled out of the lock, fell out of her hand.</p>
    <p>After having somewhat recovered her surprise, she took up the key, locked the door, and went upstairs into her
        chamber to recover herself; but she could not, she was so much frightened. Having observed that the key of the
        closet was stained with blood, she tried two or three times to wipe it off, but the blood would not come out; in
        vain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand; the blood still remained, for the key was magical and
        she could never make it quite clean; when the blood was gone off from one side, it came again on the other.</p>
    <p>Blue Beard returned from his journey the same evening, and said he had received letters upon the road, informing
        him that the affair he went about was ended to his advantage. His wife did all she could to convince him she was
        extremely glad of his speedy return.</p>
    <p>Next morning he asked her for the keys, which she gave him, but with such a trembling hand that he easily guessed
        what had happened.</p>
    <p>“What!” said he, “is not the key of my closet among the rest?”</p>
    <p>“I must certainly have left it above upon the table,” said she.</p>
    <p>“Fail not to bring it to me presently,” said Blue Beard.</p>
    <p>After several goings backward and forward she was forced to bring him the key. Blue Beard, having very
        attentively considered it, said to his wife,</p>
    <p>“How comes this blood upon the key?”</p>
    <p>“I do not know,” cried the poor woman, paler than death.</p>
    <p>“You do not know!” replied Blue Beard. “I very well know. You were resolved to go into the closet, were you not?
        Mighty well, madam; you shall go in, and take your place among the ladies you saw there.”</p>
    <p>Upon this she threw herself at her husband’s feet, and begged his pardon with all the signs of true repentance,
        vowing that she would never more be disobedient. She would have melted a rock, so beautiful and sorrowful was
        she; but Blue Beard had a heart harder than any rock!</p>
    <p>“You must die, madam,” said he, “and that presently.”</p>
    <p>“Since I must die,” answered she (looking upon him with her eyes all bathed in tears), “give me some little time
        to say my prayers.”</p>
    <p>“I give you,” replied Blue Beard, “half a quarter of an hour, but not one moment more.”</p>
    <p>When she was alone she called out to her sister, and said to her:</p>
    <p>“Sister Anne” (for that was her name), “go up, I beg you, upon the top of the tower, and look if my brothers are
        not coming over; they promised me that they would come to-day, and if you see them, give them a sign to make
        haste.”</p>
    <p>Her sister Anne went up upon the top of the tower, and the poor afflicted wife cried out from time to time:</p>
    <p>“Anne, sister Anne, do you see anyone coming?”</p>
    <p>And sister Anne said:</p>
    <p>“I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which looks green.”</p>
    <p>In the meanwhile Blue Beard, holding a great sabre in his hand, cried out as loud as he could bawl to his wife:
    </p>
    <p>“Come down instantly, or I shall come up to you.”</p>
    <p>“One moment longer, if you please,” said his wife, and then she cried out very softly, “Anne, sister Anne, dost
        thou see anybody coming?”</p>
    <p>And sister Anne answered:</p>
    <p>“I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which is green.”</p>
    <p>“Come down quickly,” cried Blue Beard, “or I will come up to you.”</p>
    <p>“I am coming,” answered his wife; and then she cried, “Anne, sister Anne, dost thou not see anyone coming?”</p>
    <p>“I see,” replied sister Anne, “a great dust, which comes on this side here.”</p>
    <p>“Are they my brothers?”</p>
    <p>“Alas! no, my dear sister, I see a flock of sheep.”</p>
    <p>“Will you not come down?” cried Blue Beard</p>
    <p>“One moment longer,” said his wife, and then she cried out: “Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see nobody coming?”</p>
    <p>“I see,” said she, “two horsemen, but they are yet a great way off.”</p>
    <p>“God be praised,” replied the poor wife joyfully; “they are my brothers; I will make them a sign, as well as I
        can, for them to make haste.”</p>
    <p>Then Blue Beard bawled out so loud that he made the whole house tremble. The distressed wife came down, and threw
        herself at his feet, all in tears, with her hair about her shoulders.</p>
    <p>“This signifies nothing,” says Blue Beard; “you must die”; then, taking hold of her hair with one hand, and
        lifting up the sword with the other, he was going to take off her head. The poor lady, turning about to him, and
        looking at him with dying eyes, desired him to afford her one little moment to recollect herself.</p>
    <p>“No, no,” said he, “recommend thyself to God,” and was just ready to strike...</p>
    <p>At this very instant there was such a loud knocking at the gate that Blue Beard made a sudden stop. The gate was
        opened, and presently entered two horsemen, who, drawing their swords, ran directly to Blue Beard. He knew them
        to be his wife’s brothers, one a dragoon, the other a musketeer, so that he ran away immediately to save
        himself; but the two brothers pursued so close that they overtook him before he could get to the steps of the
        porch, when they ran their swords through his body and left him dead. The poor wife was almost as dead as her
        husband, and had not strength enough to rise and welcome her brothers.</p>
    <p>Blue Beard had no heirs, and so his wife became mistress of all his estate. She made use of one part of it to
        marry her sister Anne to a young gentleman who had loved her a long while; another part to buy captains
        commissions for her brothers, and the rest to marry herself to a very worthy gentleman, who made her forget the
        ill time she had passed with Blue Beard.(1)</p>
