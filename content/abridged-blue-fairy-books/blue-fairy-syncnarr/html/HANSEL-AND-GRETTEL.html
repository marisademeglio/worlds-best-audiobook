        <h1 id="sn-0">HANSEL AND GRETTEL</h1>
        <p><span id="sn-1">
            Once upon a time there dwelt on the outskirts of a large forest a poor woodcutter with his wife and two children;
                the boy was called Hansel and the girl Grettel.
        </span> <span id="sn-2">
            He had always little enough to live on, and once, when there was
                a great famine in the land, he couldn’t even provide them with daily bread.
        </span> <span id="sn-3">
            One night, as he was tossing about
                in bed, full of cares and worry, he sighed and said to his wife: “What’s to become of us? how are we to support
                our poor children, now that we have nothing more for ourselves?”
        </span> <span id="sn-4">
            “I’ll tell you what, husband,” answered the
                woman; “early to-morrow morning we’ll take the children out into the thickest part of the wood; there we shall
                light a fire for them and give them each a piece of bread; then we’ll go on to our work and leave them alone.
                They won’t be able to find their way home, and we shall thus be rid of them.”
        </span> <span id="sn-5">
            “No, wife,” said her husband,
                “that I won’t do; how could I find it in my heart to leave my children alone in the wood? The wild beasts would
                soon come and tear them to pieces.”
        </span> <span id="sn-6">
            “Oh! you fool,” said she, “then we must all four die of hunger, and you may
                just as well go and plane the boards for our coffins”;
        </span> <span id="sn-7">
            and she left him no peace till he consented. “But I can’t
                help feeling sorry for the poor children,” added the husband.
        </span></p>
        <p><span id="sn-8">
            The children, too, had not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their
                father.
        </span> <span id="sn-9">Grettel wept bitterly and spoke to Hansel: “Now it’s all up with us.”</span> <span id="sn-10">
            “No, no, Grettel,” said Hansel,
                “don’t fret yourself; I’ll be able to find a way to escape, no fear.”
        </span> <span id="sn-11">
            And when the old people had fallen asleep
                he got up, slipped on his little coat, opened the back door and stole out.
        </span> <span id="sn-12">
            The moon was shining clearly, and the
                white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like bits of silver.
        </span> <span id="sn-13">
            Hansel bent down and filled his
                pocket with as many of them as he could cram in.
        </span> <span id="sn-14">
            Then he went back and said to Grettel: “Be comforted, my dear
                little sister, and go to sleep: God will not desert us”; and he lay down in bed again.
        </span></p>
        <p><span id="sn-15">
            At daybreak, even before the sun was up, the woman came and woke the two children: “Get up, you lie-abeds, we’re
                all going to the forest to fetch wood.”
        </span> <span id="sn-16">
            She gave them each a bit of bread and said: “There’s something for your
                luncheon, but don’t you eat it up before, for it’s all you’ll get.”
        </span> <span id="sn-17">
            Grettel took the bread under her apron, as
                Hansel had the stones in his pocket.
        </span> <span id="sn-18">Then they all set out together on the way to the forest.</span> <span id="sn-19">
            After they had
                walked for a little, Hansel stood still and looked back at the house, and this maneuver he repeated again and
                again.
        </span> <span id="sn-20">
            His father observed him, and said: “Hansel, what are you gazing at there, and why do you always remain
                behind? Take care, and don’t lose your footing.”
        </span> <span id="sn-21">
            “Oh! father,” said Hansel, “I am looking back at my white
                kitten, which is sitting on the roof, waving me a farewell.”
        </span> <span id="sn-22">
            The woman exclaimed: “What a donkey you are! that
                isn’t your kitten, that’s the morning sun shining on the chimney.”
        </span> <span id="sn-23">
            But Hansel had not looked back at his kitten,
                but had always dropped one of the white pebbles out of his pocket on to the path.
        </span></p>
        <p><span id="sn-24">
            When they had reached the middle of the forest the father said: “Now, children, go and fetch a lot of wood, and
                I’ll light a fire that you may not feel cold.”
        </span> <span id="sn-25">
            Hansel and Grettel heaped up brushwood till they had made a pile
                nearly the size of a small hill.
        </span> <span id="sn-26">
            The brushwood was set fire to, and when the flames leaped high the woman said:
                “Now lie down at the fire, children, and rest yourselves: we are going into the forest to cut down wood; when
                we’ve finished we’ll come back and fetch you.”
        </span> <span id="sn-27">
            Hansel and Grettel sat down beside the fire, and at midday ate
                their little bits of bread.
        </span> <span id="sn-28">They heard the strokes of the axe, so they thought their father was quite near.</span> <span id="sn-29">
            But
                it was no axe they heard, but a bough he had tied on a dead tree, and that was blown about by the wind.
        </span> <span id="sn-30">
            And when
                they had sat for a long time their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.
        </span> <span id="sn-31">
            When they awoke at last
                it was pitch dark.
        </span> <span id="sn-32">Grettel began to cry, and said: “How are we ever to get out of the wood?”</span> <span id="sn-33">
            But Hansel
                comforted her. “Wait a bit,” he said, “till the moon is up, and then we’ll find our way sure enough.”
        </span> <span id="sn-34">
            And when
                the full moon had risen he took his sister by the hand and followed the pebbles, which shone like new threepenny
                bits, and showed them the path.
        </span> <span id="sn-35">
            They walked on through the night, and at daybreak reached their father’s house
                again.
        </span> <span id="sn-36">
            They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it she exclaimed: “You naughty children, what a time
                you’ve slept in the wood! we thought you were never going to come back.”
        </span> <span id="sn-37">
            But the father rejoiced, for his
                conscience had reproached him for leaving his children behind by themselves.
        </span></p>
        <p><span id="sn-38">
            Not long afterward there was again great dearth in the land, and the children heard their mother address their
                father thus in bed one night: 
        </span><span id="sn-39">
            “Everything is eaten up once more; we have only half a loaf in the house, and when
                that’s done it’s all up with us. The children must be got rid of; we’ll lead them deeper into the wood this
                time, so that they won’t be able to find their way out again. There is no other way of saving ourselves.”
        </span> <span id="sn-40">
            The
                man’s heart smote him heavily, and he thought: “Surely it would be better to share the last bite with one’s
                children!”
        </span> <span id="sn-41">
            But his wife wouldn’t listen to his arguments, and did nothing but scold and reproach him. If a man
                yields once he’s done for, and so, because he had given in the first time, he was forced to do so the second.
        </span>
        </p>
        <p><span id="sn-42">But the children were awake, and had heard the conversation.</span> <span id="sn-43">
            When the old people were asleep Hansel got up, and
                wanted to go out and pick up pebbles again, as he had done the first time; but the woman had barred the door,
                and Hansel couldn’t get out.
        </span> <span id="sn-44">
            But he consoled his little sister, and said: “Don’t cry, Grettel, and sleep
                peacefully, for God is sure to help us.”
        </span></p>
        <p><span id="sn-45">At early dawn the woman came and made the children get up.</span> <span id="sn-46">
            They received their bit of bread, but it was even
                smaller than the time before.
        </span> <span id="sn-47">
            On the way to the wood Hansel crumbled it in his pocket, and every few minutes he
                stood still and dropped a crumb on the ground. 
        </span><span id="sn-48">
            “Hansel, what are you stopping and looking about you for?” said
                the father. 
        </span><span id="sn-49">
            “I’m looking back at my little pigeon, which is sitting on the roof waving me a farewell,” answered
                Hansel.
        </span> <span id="sn-50">“Fool!” said the wife; “that isn’t your pigeon, it’s the morning sun glittering on the chimney.” </span><span id="sn-51">
            But
                Hansel gradually threw all his crumbs on the path.
        </span> <span id="sn-52">
            The woman led the children still deeper into the forest
                farther than they had ever been in their lives before.
        </span> <span id="sn-53">
            Then a big fire was lit again, and the mother said: “Just
                sit down there, children, and if you’re tired you can sleep a bit; we’re going into the forest to cut down wood,
                and in the evening when we’re finished we’ll come back to fetch you.” 
        </span><span id="sn-54">
            At midday Grettel divided her bread with
                Hansel, for he had strewn his all along their path. 
        </span><span id="sn-55">
            Then they fell asleep, and evening passed away, but nobody
                came to the poor children. 
        </span><span id="sn-56">
            They didn’t awake till it was pitch dark, and Hansel comforted his sister, saying:
                “Only wait, Grettel, till the moon rises, then we shall see the bread-crumbs I scattered along the path; they
                will show us the way back to the house.” 
        </span><span id="sn-57">
            When the moon appeared they got up, but they found no crumbs, for the
                thousands of birds that fly about the woods and fields had picked them all up. 
        </span><span id="sn-58">
            “Never mind,” said Hansel to
                Grettel; “you’ll see we’ll find a way out”; but all the same they did not. 
        </span><span id="sn-59">
            They wandered about the whole night,
                and the next day, from morning till evening, but they could not find a path out of the wood. 
        </span><span id="sn-60">
            They were very
                hungry, too, for they had nothing to eat but a few berries they found growing on the ground. 
        </span><span id="sn-61">
            And at last they
                were so tired that their legs refused to carry them any longer, so they lay down under a tree and fell fast
                asleep.
        </span></p>
        <p><span id="sn-62">
            On the third morning after they had left their father’s house they set about their wandering again, but only got
                deeper and deeper into the wood, and now they felt that if help did not come to them soon they must perish. 
        </span><span id="sn-63">
            At
                midday they saw a beautiful little snow-white bird sitting on a branch, which sang so sweetly that they stopped
                still and listened to it. 
        </span><span id="sn-64">And when its song was finished it flapped its wings and flew on in front of them. </span><span id="sn-65">
            They
                followed it and came to a little house, on the roof of which it perched; and when they came quite near they saw
                that the cottage was made of bread and roofed with cakes, while the window was made of transparent sugar. 
        </span><span id="sn-66">
            “Now
                we’ll set to,” said Hansel, “and have a regular blow-out. I’ll eat a bit of the roof, and you, Grettel, can
                eat some of the window, which you’ll find a sweet morsel.”
        </span> <span id="sn-67">
            Hansel stretched up his hand and broke off a little
                bit of the roof to see what it was like, and Grettel went to the casement and began to nibble at it. 
        </span><span id="sn-68">
            Thereupon a
                shrill voice called out from the room inside:
        </span></p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="sn-69">“Nibble, nibble, little mouse,</span>
            <br>
            <span id="sn-70">Who’s nibbling my house?”</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p id="sn-71">The children answered:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="sn-72">“Tis Heaven’s own child,</span>
            <br>
            <span id="sn-73">The tempest wild,”</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><span id="sn-74">and went on eating, without putting themselves about.</span> <span id="sn-75">
            Hansel, who thoroughly appreciated the roof, tore down a
                big bit of it, while Grettel pushed out a whole round window-pane, and sat down the better to enjoy it. 
        </span><span id="sn-76">
            Suddenly
                the door opened, and an ancient dame leaning on a staff hobbled out. 
        </span><span id="sn-77">
            Hansel and Grettel were so terrified that
                they let what they had in their hands fall. 
        </span><span id="sn-78">
            But the old woman shook her head and said: “Oh, ho! you dear
                children, who led you here? Just come in and stay with me, no ill shall befall you.” 
        </span><span id="sn-79">
            She took them both by the
                hand and let them into the house, and laid a most sumptuous dinner before them—milk and sugared pancakes, with
                apples and nuts. 
        </span><span id="sn-80">
            After they had finished, two beautiful little white beds were prepared for them, and when
                Hansel and Grettel lay down in them they felt as if they had got into heaven.
        </span></p>
        
        <p><span id="sn-81">
            The old woman had appeared to be most friendly, but she was really an old witch who had waylaid the children, and
                had only built the little bread house in order to lure them in. 
        </span><span id="sn-82">
            When anyone came into her power she killed,
                cooked, and ate him, and held a regular feast-day for the occasion. 
        </span><span id="sn-83">
            Now witches have red eyes, and cannot see
                far, but, like beasts, they have a keen sense of smell, and know when human beings pass by. 
        </span><span id="sn-84">
            When Hansel and
                Grettel fell into her hands she laughed maliciously, and said jeeringly: “I’ve got them now; they sha’n’t escape
                me.” 
        </span><span id="sn-85">
            Early in the morning, before the children were awake, she rose up, and when she saw them both sleeping so
                peacefully, with their round rosy cheeks, she muttered to herself: “That’ll be a dainty bite.” 
        </span><span id="sn-86">
            Then she seized
                Hansel with her bony hand and carried him into a little stable, and barred the door on him; he might scream as
                much as he liked, it did him no good. 
        </span><span id="sn-87">
            Then she went to Grettel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: “Get up,
                you lazy-bones, fetch water and cook something for your brother. When he’s fat I’ll eat him up.” 
        </span><span id="sn-88">
            Grettel began
                to cry bitterly, but it was of no use; she had to do what the wicked witch bade her.
        </span></p>
        <p><span id="sn-89">So the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Grettel got nothing but crab-shells. </span><span id="sn-90">
            Every morning the old woman
                hobbled out to the stable and cried: “Hansel, put out your finger, that I may feel if you are getting fat.” 
        </span><span id="sn-91">
            But
                Hansel always stretched out a bone, and the old dame, whose eyes were dim, couldn’t see it, and thinking always
                it was Hansel’s finger, wondered why he fattened so slowly. 
        </span><span id="sn-92">
            When four weeks had passed and Hansel still remained
                thin, she lost patience and determined to wait no longer. 
        </span><span id="sn-93">
            “Hi, Grettel,” she called to the girl, “be quick and
                get some water. Hansel may be fat or thin, I’m going to kill him to-morrow and cook him.” 
        </span><span id="sn-94">
            Oh! how the poor
                little sister sobbed as she carried the water, and how the tears rolled down her cheeks! “Kind heaven help us
                now!” she cried; “if only the wild beasts in the wood had eaten us, then at least we should have died together.”
        </span>
            <span id="sn-95">“Just hold your peace,” said the old hag; “it won’t help you.”</span></p>
        <p><span id="sn-96">Early in the morning Grettel had to go out and hang up the kettle full of water, and light the fire. </span><span id="sn-97">
            “First we’ll
                bake,” said the old dame; “I’ve heated the oven already and kneaded the dough.”
        </span> <span id="sn-98">
            She pushed Grettel out to the
                oven, from which fiery flames were already issuing. 
        </span><span id="sn-99">
            “Creep in,” said the witch, “and see if it’s properly
                heated, so that we can shove in the bread.” 
        </span><span id="sn-100">
            For when she had got Grettel in she meant to close the oven and let
                the girl bake, that she might eat her up too. 
        </span><span id="sn-101">
            But Grettel perceived her intention, and said: “I don’t know how
                I’m to do it; how do I get in?” 
        </span><span id="sn-102">
            “You silly goose!” said the hag, “the opening is big enough; see, I could get in
                myself,” and she crawled toward it, and poked her head into the oven. 
        </span><span id="sn-103">
            Then Grettel gave her a shove that sent
                her right in, shut the iron door, and drew the bolt. 
        </span><span id="sn-104">
            Gracious! how she yelled, it was quite horrible; but
                Grettel fled, and the wretched old woman was left to perish miserably.
        </span></p>
        <p><span id="sn-105">
            Grettel flew straight to Hansel, opened the little stable-door, and cried: “Hansel, we are free; the old witch is
                dead.” 
        </span><span id="sn-106">Then Hansel sprang like a bird out of a cage when the door is opened. </span><span id="sn-107">
            How they rejoiced, and fell on each
                other’s necks, and jumped for joy, and kissed one another! 
        </span><span id="sn-108">
            And as they had no longer any cause for fear, they
                went in the old hag’s house, and here they found, in every corner of the room, boxes with pearls and precious
                stones. 
        </span><span id="sn-109">
            “These are even better than pebbles,” said Hansel, and crammed his pockets full of them; and Grettel
                said: “I too will bring something home,” and she filled her apron full. 
        </span><span id="sn-110">
            “But now,” said Hansel, “let’s go and
                get well away from the witch’s wood.” 
        </span><span id="sn-111">When they had wandered about for some hours they came to a big lake. </span><span id="sn-112">
            “We
                can’t get over,” said Hansel; “I see no bridge of any sort or kind.” 
        </span><span id="sn-113">
            “Yes, and there’s no ferry-boat either,”
                answered Grettel; “but look, there swims a white duck; if I ask her she’ll help us over,” and she called out:
        </span>
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="sn-114">"Here are two children, mournful very,</span>
            <br>
            <span id="sn-115">Seeing neither bridge nor ferry;</span>
            <br>
            <span id="sn-116">Take us upon your white back,</span>
            <br>
            <span id="sn-117">And row us over, quack, quack!"</span>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p><span id="sn-118">The duck swam toward them, and Hansel got on her back and bade his little sister sit beside him. </span><span id="sn-119">
            “No,” answered
                Grettel, “we should be too heavy a load for the duck: she shall carry us across separately.” 
        </span><span id="sn-120">
            The good bird did
                this, and when they were landed safely on the other side, and had gone for a while, the wood became more and
                more familiar to them, and at length they saw their father’s house in the distance. 
        </span><span id="sn-121">
            Then they set off to run,
                and bounding into the room fell on their father’s neck. 
        </span><span id="sn-122">
            The man had not passed a happy hour since he left them
                in the wood, but the woman had died. 
        </span><span id="sn-123">
            Grettel shook out her apron so that the pearls and precious stones rolled
                about the room, and Hansel threw down one handful after the other out of his pocket. 
        </span><span id="sn-124">
            Thus all their troubles
                were ended, and they lived happily ever afterward.
        </span></p>
        <p id="sn-125">My story is done. See! there runs a little mouse; anyone who catches it may make himself a large fur cap out of
            it.</p>
